# Organic Compound IUPAC Name Generator

- This project is an organic compound IUPAC name generator and was written in Python.

## How Does This Project Work?
- The user will be prompted to enter the organic compound in SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) format and they will receive the IUPAC name for the compound along with the skeletal formula of the compound.
- This project only runs in Jupyter Notebook. The reasoning for this is that Jupyter creates an image of the skeletal formula and it is out of scope to implement that in the terminal. 

## Software/Tools Needed:
- Visual Studio Code
- Python3
- Rdkit
- Jupyter Notebook
